Put you P O T down on the stove half heat
Dump enough olive oil to just cover the bottom of the P O T
Throw two popcorn kernels in the P O T, and close the lid
Wait... Until the popcorn kernels have popped
now you pour half a cup of popcorn kernels into the p o t
and shake the pot while the kernels are popping to make sure they don't burn on the bottom
Now they are don! just CAREFULLY pour them into a large bowl and sprinkle some melted butter and salt with some pepper
Yay! You made POPCORN!!!!!!!!!!!! :D
